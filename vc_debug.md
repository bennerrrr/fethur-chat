# Voice Chat Debugging Handoff Document

## üéØ **Current Mission**
Fix voice chat functionality issues where:
1. Audio is not being transmitted between users
2. Admin user connects slower than testuser
3. Users are not properly joining voice channels
4. Backend deadlocks and stops processing messages

## üìã **Issues Identified & Status**

### ‚úÖ **FIXED Issues**
1. **Backend Deadlock** - Restarted backend to clear deadlock
2. **Ping Messages with Wrong Channel ID** - Updated `writePump` method to include correct `channelID` and `serverID`
3. **Pong Responses Missing Channel Info** - Updated `handlePing` method to include channel information
4. **Voice Activity Detection Issues** - Added checks in `setSpeaking()` to only send messages when connected and in channel

### üîß **Code Changes Made**

#### Backend (`server/internal/voice/signaling.go`)
```go
// Fixed ping messages in writePump method
case <-ticker.C:
    c.mutex.RLock()
    channelID := c.channelID
    c.mutex.RUnlock()
    
    pingMessage := &VoiceMessage{
        Type:      "ping",
        ChannelID: channelID,  // Now includes actual channel ID
        ServerID:  c.serverID,
        UserID:    c.ID,
        Username:  c.Username,
        Timestamp: time.Now(),
    }
    c.sendMessage(pingMessage)

// Fixed pong responses in handlePing method
func (h *VoiceHub) handlePing(message *VoiceMessage) {
    // ... existing code ...
    client.mutex.Lock()
    client.lastSeen = time.Now()
    channelID := client.channelID
    serverID := client.serverID
    client.mutex.Unlock()

    client.sendMessage(&VoiceMessage{
        Type:      "pong",
        ChannelID: channelID,  // Now includes channel info
        ServerID:  serverID,
        UserID:    message.UserID,
        Username:  client.Username,
        Timestamp: time.Now(),
    })
}
```

#### Frontend (`client/web/src/lib/webrtc/voice.ts`)
```typescript
// Added debugging to handleChannelJoined
private async handleChannelJoined(message: any) {
    console.log('Received channel-joined message:', message);
    const { channel_id, server_id, channel_name, clients } = message.data;
    
    this.state.update(s => ({
        ...s,
        currentChannelId: channel_id
    }));

    console.log(`Joined voice channel: ${channel_name} (${channel_id})`);
    console.log('Current state after joining:', this.getState());
    // ... rest of method
}

// Enhanced setSpeaking with better logging
private setSpeaking(speaking: boolean): void {
    this.state.update(s => ({ ...s, isSpeaking: speaking }));

    if (this.speakingTimeout) {
        clearTimeout(this.speakingTimeout);
    }

    const state = this.getState();
    
    console.log('setSpeaking called:', { 
        speaking, 
        state: { 
            isConnected: state.isConnected, 
            currentChannelId: state.currentChannelId, 
            wsState: this.ws?.readyState 
        } 
    });
    
    if (state.isConnected && state.currentChannelId && this.ws?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        console.log('Sending speaking message with channel_id:', state.currentChannelId);
        this.sendMessage({
            type: 'speaking',
            channel_id: state.currentChannelId,
            data: speaking
        });
    } else {
        console.log('Not sending speaking message - conditions not met');
    }
    // ... rest of method
}
```

## üîç **Current Investigation Status**

### **Backend Logs Analysis**
- **Issue**: Backend stopped processing voice messages after 21:11
- **Evidence**: No recent "Processing voice message" or "Voice hub: processing message" logs
- **Status**: Backend restarted, monitoring for new connections

### **Frontend Connection Issues**
- **Issue**: Frontend not establishing new voice WebSocket connections after restart
- **Evidence**: No recent "Voice client registered" messages
- **Status**: Frontend restarted, ready for testing

### **Channel Joining Problems**
- **Issue**: Users sending join-channel messages but not receiving channel-joined responses
- **Evidence**: Recent join-channel messages (21:19, 21:24) not processed by backend
- **Status**: Backend restart should resolve this

## üß™ **Testing Instructions for Next Agent**

### **1. Verify Backend Status**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl -s http://localhost:8081/health

# Check recent backend logs
tail -n 50 logs/backend.log | grep -E "(voice|join|admin|testuser|speaking|offer|answer|ice)"
```

### **2. Test Voice Functionality**
1. **Open application** at `https://localhost:5173/`
2. **Login as both users** (admin and testuser) in separate browser windows
3. **Navigate to voice channel** (Voice Chat in server 1)
4. **Click "Join Voice"** button for both users
5. **Check browser console** for new debug messages
6. **Test audio transmission** between users

### **3. Monitor Logs During Testing**
```bash
# Monitor backend logs in real-time
tail -f logs/backend.log | grep -E "(voice|join|channel|speaking|offer|answer|ice)"

# Check for voice client registrations
grep -i "Voice client registered" logs/backend.log | tail -n 10

# Check for join-channel processing
grep -i "handleJoinChannel\|channel-joined" logs/backend.log | tail -n 10
```

## üéØ **Expected Behavior After Fixes**

### **Ping Messages**
- Should show `channel_id: 2` instead of `channel_id: 0`
- Should include `server_id: 1` and proper `username`

### **Channel Joining**
- Users should receive `channel-joined` messages with proper channel info
- Frontend should update `currentChannelId` state
- WebRTC offers should be created and sent between users

### **Voice Activity**
- Speaking messages should only be sent when connected to a channel
- Messages should include correct `channel_id`

## üîß **Potential Next Steps**

### **If Issues Persist**

1. **Check WebRTC Signaling**
   ```bash
   # Look for offer/answer messages
   grep -i "offer\|answer\|ice" logs/backend.log | tail -n 20
   ```

2. **Verify Frontend State**
   - Check browser console for "Received channel-joined message" logs
   - Verify `currentChannelId` is being set correctly
   - Check for WebRTC peer connection creation

3. **Database Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify user memberships
   sqlite3 server/data/fethur.db "SELECT user_id, server_id, role FROM server_members WHERE user_id IN (1, 9);"
   
   # Verify voice channel exists
   sqlite3 server/data/fethur.db "SELECT id, server_id, name, channel_type FROM channels WHERE channel_type='voice';"
   ```

### **If Audio Still Not Working**

1. **Check WebRTC Peer Connections**
   - Look for `createPeerConnection` logs in browser console
   - Verify `ontrack` events are firing
   - Check for audio element creation

2. **Browser Permissions**
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted
   - Check for autoplay policy issues
   - Verify audio devices are working

3. **Network Issues**
   - Check STUN server connectivity
   - Verify ICE candidates are being exchanged
   - Look for connection state changes

## üìä **Key Files Modified**

1. **`server/internal/voice/signaling.go`**
   - Fixed ping message generation
   - Fixed pong response handling
   - Added proper channel ID inclusion

2. **`client/web/src/lib/webrtc/voice.ts`**
   - Enhanced debugging in `handleChannelJoined`
   - Improved `setSpeaking` with better logging
   - Added state validation

## üö® **Critical Issues to Watch**

1. **Backend Deadlocks** - Monitor for message processing stops
2. **Channel ID = 0** - All messages should have proper channel IDs
3. **Missing WebRTC Signaling** - Look for offer/answer/ice-candidate messages
4. **Frontend State Mismatches** - Verify `currentChannelId` is set correctly

## üìù **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Both users can join voice channel successfully
- [ ] Ping messages show correct `channel_id: 2`
- [ ] Speaking messages include proper channel information
- [ ] WebRTC offers/answers are exchanged between users
- [ ] Audio is transmitted and received between users
- [ ] No backend deadlocks or message processing stops
