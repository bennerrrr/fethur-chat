    UserID      string    `json:"user_id"`
    Tier        string    `json:"tier"` // community, pro, enterprise
    Status      string    `json:"status"` // active, cancelled, expired
    StartDate   time.Time `json:"start_date"`
    EndDate     time.Time `json:"end_date"`
    StripeSubID string    `json:"stripe_subscription_id"`
}

// Feature access control
func HasFeature(userID string, feature string) bool {
    subscription := GetUserSubscription(userID)
    return subscription.Tier.HasFeature(feature)
}
```

### Payment Integration

```go
// Stripe webhook handler
func HandleStripeWebhook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Verify webhook signature
    // Handle subscription events:
    // - customer.subscription.created
    // - customer.subscription.updated

    // - invoice.payment_succeeded
    // - invoice.payment_failed

    Name        string   `json:"name"`
    RequiredTier string   `json:"required_tier"`
