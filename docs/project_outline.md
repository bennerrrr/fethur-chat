Account information:
for the local instance of this project, clients should be able to make a username and a hashed key or soemthing is stored on their client to use as authentication. this form of an account cannot be used with cloud based servers, only the local network. For other accounts, this could be tackled by a best practice regarding the most secure way to comeplte this implementation. 

Client
I want this client to be minimal in design, yet intuitive to use. I do not want this front end to look like a complete discord ripoff. when setting up servers, there should be a basic config file that allows for a master server password to be set, also a server backend ui would be awesome, allign for server permissions and admin controls. (reference the monitization guide for this implementation)

Backend:
While developing, I want the main backend server to be hostable in docker so i can test the full stack on my local network, similar to a real deployment
Efficiency is KEY, please always use best practices and write secure and predictable code to help with future debudding.
