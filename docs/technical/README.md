## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### Security Implementation
1. Review [ADVANCED_SECURITY_FEATURES.md](./ADVANCED_SECURITY_FEATURES.md) for security requirements
2. Follow implementation roadmap for phased security rollout
3. Use provided code examples and best practices

### Understanding Voice Features
1. Start with [WEBRTC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./WEBRTC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for overview
2. Deep dive into [WEBRTC_PERFORMANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./WEBRTC_PERFORMANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for implementation

### Plugin Development
1. Review [PLUGIN_BOT_ARCHITECTURE_RESEARCH.md](./PLUGIN_BOT_ARCHITECTURE_RESEARCH.md) for architecture
2. Check [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for development setup

### Architecture Decisions
All technical documents include detailed research methodology and decision rationale to help you understand not just what to implement, but why these approaches were chosen.
